# datatables-and-tabulator-demo
Sorting columns of a table is rather easy using Datatables.net. However,
sorting a column holding dates has always been a bit tricky. 

Here I'll show two ways of sorting a simple table.
1. using jQuery, Datatables.net and Datatables.net plugins
2. using vue-tabulator

Note that both date sortings are based on moment.js.

Here is how it looks:
