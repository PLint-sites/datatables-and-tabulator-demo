# datatables-and-tabulator-demo
Sorting columns of a table is rather easy using Datatables.net. However,
sorting a column holding dates has always been a bit tricky. 

Here I'll show three ways of sorting a simple table.
1. using jQuery, Datatables.net and Datatables.net plugins
2. using vue-tabulator
3. using grid.js (and it's Vue plugin)

Note that the first tow options use moment.js for date sorting. The latter uses dayjs, the light weight alternative to moment.
